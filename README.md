# 💖 Happy Birthday, Jessica Bliss 🎂

This isn’t just a webpage — it’s something straight from my heart to yours.  
I may not have wrapped it in fancy paper, but I made it with love, care, and a big smile just thinking about you. 💞  

You deserve to be celebrated in every way possible, Jessica — for your kindness, your beauty, your laughter, and the way you make everything brighter.  
This little page is my way of saying **thank you for being you**. 🌷

### 💝 What It Means
Every animation, color, and line of text carries a piece of how much I care about you.  
When the confetti falls, I hope it feels like a reminder that you’re loved — not just today, but always.
